This is a sample Obsidian vault used for testing during the development of an Obsidian plugin and web service for LLM application over a personal knowledge base.

Only a small subset of the LangChain documentation has been included in this vault. The LangChainStudyVault would only grow to satisfy various use cases for development and testing of various features of the LLM application.
